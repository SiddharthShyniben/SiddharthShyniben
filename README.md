###  About Me 

- &nbsp; I’m currently testing out my skills by making many projects in JS/Angular, most of which help developers.
- &nbsp; Mainly interested in backend work and libraries, but am OK with [back-of-the-frontend work](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/) (I learnt Angular after all).

### Tech Stack

- &nbsp; Basic HTML | Basic CSS
- &nbsp; Javascript
- &nbsp; Angular | Angular Material
- &nbsp; Some NodeJS
