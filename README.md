# Sid here!

I'm a full-stack hobbyist developer who loves learning. I thrive at the soft
spot between building cool stuff and learning new things.

I have started tons of projects but haven't finished them, because I prefer
experimenting over completing projects. I've been described as "a god level
developer who doesn't build projects". However, there are some of my notable
projects [here](#projects)

I'm primarily the best at JavaScript and I've built tons of things in it. But I
am also pretty good at HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Angular, and Svelte. I also know
bits of C, Java, Rust and Go.

I also have a blog.

## What I do

I mainly do open source. Like I said, I love experimenting and I don't really
see the need to keep my stuff closed. I do have a few closed source projects but
I don't really work on them.
